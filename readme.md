Mission:

Your mission is to get through all three levels and reach the bug princess at the end. Avoid the enemies and collect the keys to open the doors — and win the princess’s heart!

Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right. If you run into an enemy, your character will reset to the starting point. When the game ends, refresh the page to play again.
